This repository is just an example with some comments of what i've done to my personal bot. (Some part of functions, like return strings and functions names is in portuguese, if you don't understand just put in https://translate.google.com/?sl=pt&tl=en&op=translate

The bot functionalities can may not serve to you, but serve as an example. The gsheets script can serve as your base to start manipulate gsheets via python.

You can also see Sheets API references in: https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python

And here is the Discord.py library, with extense documentation and tons of examples: https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py


Enjoy!
